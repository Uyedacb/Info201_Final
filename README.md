# Info201_Final

This repository contains R code for the final project in INFO201a Spring 2018.

The project utilizes Shiny to analyze and show data representations of mental health specifically related to depression.

We ask the question, what are the biggest contributors to depression and how are they correlated to the frequency of suicidal tendencies? We attempt to answer this question by analyzing the data taken from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health in 2015. Our application represents this data through different visualizations that hope to engage users in our overall question.
